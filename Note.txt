p:nth-child(2) { color: red; } /* Now incorrect */
p:nth-of-type(2) { color: red; } /* Still works */

I feel like :nth-of-type is less fragile and more useful in general, despite :nth-child being more common (in my eyes).
How often do you think “I want to select the second child of a parent if it just happens to be a paragraph.”
Possibly sometimes, but more likely you want to “select the second paragraph” or “select every third table row,”
which are cases where :nth-of-type is (again, in my eyes) a stronger choice.
